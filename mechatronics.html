<p>Mechatronics, also called mechatronics engineering, is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that focuses on the integration of mechanical, electronic and electrical engineering systems,
and also includes a combination of robotics, electronics, computer science, telecommunications, systems, control, and product engineering.<br>
<p></p>
As technology advances over time, various subfields of engineering have succeeded in both adapting and multiplying.<br> The intention of mechatronics is to produce a design solution that unifies each of these various subfields. Originally, the field of mechatronics was intended to be nothing more than a combination of mechanics and electronics, hence the name being a portmanteau of mechanics and electronics; however, as the complexity of technical systems continued to evolve, the definition had been broadened to include more technical areas.<br>
